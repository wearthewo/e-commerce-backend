This is a backend CRUD app with user authentication. We use no sql databases MongoDB and Redis. In Mongo we create Users and Products models and in Redis we store frequently accessed data such as Refresh Tokens and  publicly available products. For the authentications we use JWT Tokens and we put them into Cookies to check user authentication We also use middleware with protected and admin routes for checking if the user is a simple visitor or an authenticated customer or an admin. For the CRUD operation we create logic for geting creating updating deleting and sorting products according to the user's permissions using each time MongoDB and Redis for the data manipulation. Finally, we use cloud services so as the admin who creates the products to store the images.
